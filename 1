  Active Directory is a directory service created by Microsoft in 1996 and intended for installation on Windows.
The main function of Active Directory is to enable administrators to manage permissions and control access to network resources. In Active Directory, data is stored as objects, which include users, groups, applications, and devices, and these objects are categorized according to their name.

## Active Directory information is used to authenticate/ authorize the Users, Computers, resourses are part of a network

## ACTIVE DERECTORY SERVICES
Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) are the core functions of Active Directory for managing users and computers and for enabling system administrators to organize data into logical hierarchies.

AD DS provides security certificates, single sign-on (SSO), LDAP, and rights management.

#   Active Directory servises:
    
#   Terms:
   Sheme :the set of configured user rules that govern objects and attributes in AD DS.
   Global Catalog  : the container for all AD DS objects. If you need to find a user's name, that name is stored in the global catalog.
   Query and Index Mechanism  : This system allows users to find each other in AD. For example, when you start typing a name in your email client, your email client suggests        possible matches.
   Replication  service: the replication service ensures that all domain controllers in the network share the same global catalog and the same schema
   Sites  : sites are representations of the network topology; This allows AD DS to know which objects belong together, which allows it to optimize replication and indexing.
   Lightweight Directory Access Protocol  :  LDAP  is a protocol that allows AD to communicate with other directory services on other platforms.
    
# Provide
   Domain Services  : Stores data and manages communications between users and the domain controller. This is the main feature of AD DS.
   Certificate Services  : Enables your domain controller to serve certificates and digital signatures, as well as public key encryption.
   Lightweight Directory Services  : Supports LDAP for cross-platform domain services, such as all Linux computers on your network.
   Directory Federation Services  : In the same session, provides SSO authentication for multiple applications. Thus, users are not required to re-enter the same identifiers.
   Rights management  : controls information rights and data access policies. For example, rights management determines whether you can access a folder or send an email.
